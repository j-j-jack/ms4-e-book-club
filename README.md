## **UX Design**
### **Strategy plane**

The strategy plane for the site was completed with consideration to the business objectives along with the user needs.

#### **Value Provided to the Business**

The main value of the site provided to the business is by allowing them to generate a profit. The profit is generated from users making individual purchases of e-books as well as subscribing themselves to the various genre of book-clubs on the site. It also allows them to develop a new brand and study the market for expansion at a future date. The site also allows users to review the books on the site. This gives the business feedback on the books they are choosing to put on the site and adjust depending whether the books are popular or not.

#### **Value Provided to the Users**

The site provides value to the users in several ways. The obvious value the site gives them is in the opportunity provided to purchase e-books at a reasonable price. Another main value provided by the site is its ability to aid the users in choosing which books to purchase and read. This is achieved in three main ways. Firstly, the site provides the users with rich descriptions of the books on the product pages. Secondly, the users can subscribe to book clubs in which the books of the month are provided for the various genres of books advertised on the site. Finally the site has a review section on the product pages which the users can read in order to help them in determine whether an individual book is worth reading or not.

#### **B2C Considerations**

Due to the site being used by a business to consumer business several considerations were made taking this into account. The images on the site are large. The content is minimal where possible and is designed to draw users in. The site navigation is designed to be intuitive and simple. The prices on the site are always visible to the user and the purhase buttons are large and eye-catching. This is in order to support impulse buying. The site uses strong branding. The branding of the site is ... . The above considerations keep the user in a good mood while using the site creating a positive experience. This is important as it keeps the users returning to the site. It also means that users would be more likely to recommend the site to their friends.

#### **Cultural Considerations**

The site is designed to be used by those who enjoy reading. This could possibly include older people. This means that it is important for the site to be as user-friendly as possibly. 

#### **Business Objectives**

When completing the strategy section of the UX design for the site the business outlined several objectives. The objectives are as follows:

* To curate and sell a collection of e-books
* To generate a profit
* To create book clubs for the various categories of books
* To create a strong site branding and positive user experience so that users would recommend the site to others
* To provide compelling reasons on the site for users to purchase the e-books
* To create a newsletter for site-users to subscribe to
* To offere discounts when users sign up to more than one book club 
* To create a blog where authors of books advertised on the site are interviewed
* To allow users to sign up for marketing emails
* To collect feedback for the books on the site in order to adjust to consumer demands
* To have an eye-catching landing page as well as an eye-catching site in general
* To provide links to the business' social media pages
* To give users information about the company philosophy
* To have their card/address information saved for ease of use

#### **User Needs**

When completing the strategy section of the UX design for the site, several user needs were identified. The needs are as follows:

* To register an account and login
* To purchase individual e-books 
* To download the books that they have paid for
* To read descriptions and information about the books on the site
* To read a write reviews for the books they wish to/have purchased
* To navigate around the site with ease
* To search for individual book titles
* To subscribe to the book clubs in order to receive the top books in any given category for the month
* To view and edit their basket
* To view current subscriptions and unsubscribe if desired
* To view the collection of books that they have paid for
* To read supplementary information relating to the books on the site such as a newsletter or blog
* To view the business' social media pages
* To understand the business philosophy

On reviewing the business goals and user needs, a table of opportunities was created and their importance was compared with their viability to decide which opportunities should be pursued and which should be disregarded.

#### **Opportunities Table**

| To allow users to write reviews on the books they have purchased/intend to purchase    | 3     | 4     | Y       | This is somewhat important and of features of the site that are not part of the core functionality, this is the most easily achieved                                             |
| To allow users to check out their basket                                               | 5     | 5     | Y       | This is part of the core functionality and must be included                                                                                                                      |

| To create a blog where authors of the e-books advertised on the site are interviewed   | 2     | 1     | N       | This is also very difficult and the reward/cost ratio does not imply that this should be attempted                                                                               |

| To allow users to view edit their subscriptions and unsubscribe if necessary           | 5     | 4     | Y       | This is absolutely necessary because without some means for the users to unsubscribe, there would be a lot of complaints and possibly legal action taken against the site-owners |

### **Scope Plane**

#### **Site Features**

The site features for the current build of the site are dictated by the opportunities which were not traded off above.

* Login and register forms - There will be a login/register button which will link the user to these forms. Once the user is logged in they will have access to other site features that would not otherwise be accessible. 

* Navbar - The navbar of the site plays a key role in allowing the user to navigate the site quickly and efficiently. The links to be included in the navbar are best-sellers, fiction, non-fiction, child/teen and book-clubs. The first three of the afore-mentioned links will have dropdowns to navigate to the individual categories of books within these broader classifications.

* Book-club pages - These pages will show the top books for each category in a wider classification (ie. fiction, non-fiction or child-teen). From these pages the user will be able to subscribe to any individual book club.

* Subscription buttons - These buttons will be present on the book-club pages as well as the user's subscription page. These links will navigate the user to a pay-wall where they can pay for the subscription.

* Subscription pages for individual users - These can be navigate to from a link at the top of the page and will allow the user to view their current subscriptions and unsubscribe if necessary. They will also be able to subscibe to any of the book clubs they are not subscribed to from this page.

* Products pages - This page will display the information about the individual e-books with a cover picture. It will also contain a reviews section.

* Reviews section - This section will contain reviews of the book that is currently being viewed. Users who are not logged in can read the reviews but will not be able to write one themselves. Users who are logged in will be able to write reviews as well.

* Searchbar - This will allow users to search for individual book titles and along with the navbar will be visible on all pages. It will return a page with the search results once it is submitted.

* Landing page carousel - This is present to create an eye-catching and engaging site design. It wil contain links to the individual book clubs and the bestsellers with some eye-catching imagery.

* Social media links - these will be present in the footer for the site and will navigate the user to a new tab for each link clicked on.

### **Structure Plane** 

#### **Interaction Design**

1. Consistency - The site should remain consitant across all pages. This includes the following.
    * The navbar will remain at the top of the page and the footer at the bottom. 
    * There will be a burger icon on all pages instead of a nav-bar on smaller screen sizes. 
    * Styling will also remain consitant across all pages.
2. Predictablity -
    * All links will take the user to expected locations.
    * Clicking on the logo will take the user back to the home page as is convention. 
3. Learnability -
    * There will be active links on the navbar so that the user will know what page they are on. 
    * Pages with the same function will have the same layout to provide the user with a better sense of place and navigational possibilities. 
4. Visibility -
    * When possible as much page content for each page will be visible on each page. 
    * In situations where the content exceeds that of the screen size content hinting will be used. 
5. Feedback - There will be clear and consistant feedback given to site users -
    * Buttons that link the user to other locations will highlight when the mouse is over them.
    * For links and other clickable items the cursor will change to a pointer. 
    * Messages will appear to inform the user that their actions were successful or whether errors have occurred

#### **Information Architecture**

The site operates using a traditional navigational system with a navbar at the top of the page. The site reveals more information with as the user goes from the home page to the product page to the product detail pages. The site containers other links above the navbar as is common with e-commerce sites The site also uses a search so that the user can search for whatever they are looking for quickly . There are also admin links present in the profile dropdown as is commonly practiced. Finally there is a 'load more' setup on certain pages such as the reviews section and products pages so that the user is not delayed with loading times if they do not wish to see more from the outset.

### **Skeleton Plane**

The site uses icons as metaphors. Examples of these include the a person icon for the profile as well as the burger icon which represents represents a menu dropping down for the navbar on small screens for example. The information on the site will be displayed in order of importance. An example of this is the home page where the large carousel centrepiece provides the user with links to the main pages of the site. This is because the stories in the feed are more important. Content on the site will be well spaced and will be easy to read with good colour contrast. This is good information design.

### **Surface Plane**

<br>

Below are the surface plane considerations that were made for the site
<br><br>

#### **Colour**

The colours chosen for the site are minimal. The font for the site is black and the background is white for good legibility. The navbar colour is vibrant so to compliment the many colours displayed on the book covers across the site.<br><br>

#### **Layout**

The site  attempts to create elements from the same sections aligned linearly to help in defining where sections begin and end for the user. The site uses changes of color in the navbar and footer to define sections. The site also uses borders and boxes to define which elements belong to particular sections. <br><br>

#### **Fonts**

The font chosen for the site are the fonts 'Garamond'. It is a literary font and matches the pages of books that were printed from the last century to remind users that reading is timeless.<br><br>

#### **Images**

The icons used on the site will be chosen according to how recognisable they are. The carousel images were designed to be eye-catching and to stand out from one another<br><br>

#### **Order and Sequence**

The most important elements on the site are the most easily recognized. The navbar provides the user with all the main links to the site. The home page carousel is also designed to stand out to encourage the user to browse the products. The search bar at the top of the site is very large in order to convey to the user that the site contains a large amount of titles to choose from. <br><br>

#### **Identity**

The site is a site which sells literature.The choices made in the surface plane reflect this. However it is also very modern with its choices of images and colour as it is dealing with digital products. The elements from both of these are there to compliment each other. The site attempts to link the past and present reading formats showing that although the method or reading has changed, there is still a lot of good content for readers.<br><br>
